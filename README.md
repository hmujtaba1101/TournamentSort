# TournamentSort
In tournament sort we can use priority queue on naive slection sort but we use binary heap the time complexity of priority queue and heap sort is same which is logn .. it works on nodes that compares the elements with thier neighbours and the sorted list is form by deleting a node.
In it tournaments start when num of differ players or elements take pats in it .In unsorted manner.
It starts and comapring the child and parent on binary heap the minimum one will go on the top and then the node will be remove means it will knockedout from tournament.
It works until the last element will remain in it and it will be the winner of the tournament .
The time complexity of binary heap is logn and the numbers of elements is counting one by then work containg time complexity n then mulitplying the n and logn .The final time complexity of tournament sort is nlogn.
But this sort is not stable but flexible and faster.
